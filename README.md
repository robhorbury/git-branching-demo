# Demo on Git, Branching, Rebasing and Merging

This repo is designed to give you a series of demos on git branching.
Specifically, we will look at merging, rebasing and cherry-picking commits.

## Step 1: Setup

We need to create a new repo for this demo. We will create it in the parent
folder to this repo. To do this we need to change our directory to the parent
file, then make a new folder, go into it, and initialise a repo.
``` sh
cd ..
mkdir git_demo_repo
cd git_demo_repo
git init
```
We now have a new repo - Lets add something to it. To do this, we will create a
new file, and then commit it.

```sh
touch A
git add A
git commit A -m "A"
```
We now have a file called `A` in our repo.


## Step 2: Branching

Problem: We want to add something to the repo, but we can't add it on the main
branch?

Solution: Create a branch!

We are going to create a new branch, and add our changes to it. We can then
merge our changes back into the main branch at a later point.

To create a new branch we use
```sh
git branch <branch name>
```
In this case, we will create a branch called `step2`,
so we run `git branch step2`.

We have now created a new branch - but we are still looking at the main branch:
```
âžœ git-branching-basics (main)
```
To switch to the new branch, we need to use `git checkout` or `git switch`. I
am in the habit of using _checkout_, so I will run:
```sh
git checkout step2
```

Now we are on a new branch, we want to make some changes.

We will make two changes, Create a file called `B` and commit it:
```sh
touch B
git add B
git commit B -m "B"
```
Do the same again, but for a file called `C`

```sh
touch C
git add C
git commit C -m "C"
```
Our repo will now look like this:
```
    B - C *step2
   /
  A       main
```
So far, there has been no divergence from main - we can simply add these commits
on top of main. This is what is called a _fast forward_ - We don't have to
resolve any issues, we can simply just add the commits.

### Fast Forward Merge

Lets do this as a demo. First, lets create a copy of main. We are going to do
this so that we can demonstrate the effect of a merge, within changing the state
on main:

```sh
git checkout main
git checkout -b main_fast_forward_merge
```

Now this is our current state:
```
    B - C step2
   /
  A       *main_fast_forward_merge
```

If we want to merge `step2` into `main_fast_forward_merge`, we simply need to
run:
```sh
git merge step2
```
Notice in the terminal, we will see the phrase `fast-forward`. This means git
has merged without creating a merge commit, since there was none to resolve.

Our branch now looks like this:

```
  A - B - C     *main_fast_forward_merge
```
This is our first example of a `linear history`. This means that after a merge,
our branch history is _linear_ - There are no branches or merge commits present.

### Merge

So what happens if we make a change to main, before we merge the branch?

Lets try that - first we will add new files and commit on main:
```sh
git checkout main
touch D
git add D
git commit D -m "D"
touch E
git add E
git commit E -m "E"
```
Now we have this:
```
    B - C     step2
   /
  A - D - E   main
```
This is where it gets interesting - We can no longer _fast forward_ our step2
branch onto main. How can we combine these two branches? Practically, we have 2
options, _merge_ and _rebase_.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Merging attempts to combine branches that have diverged from a common past.
>When the branches are combined, a new _merge commit_ is created.

This new commit resolves the
two branches, and indicates that two branches have been merged together.

Lets try it - but first, lets create a copy of our main branch. That we we can
come back to this point later, and compare the effect of rebasing.

Create a copy:
```sh
git checkout main
git branch main_to_merge
git checkout main_to_merge
```
This is now our setup:
```
    B - C    step2
   /
  A - D - E  main_to_merge
```
To merge these branches, we need to be on the branch that we want to merge
_into_. So in this case, we want to be on `main_to_merge`
```sh
git checkout main_to_merge
git merge step2
```
Immediately, you will notice that we need to enter a commit message - we did not
need to do this for the _fast forward_ merge. This is telling us that git is
resolving the differences in the branch, and this new commit signifies that.

Once we commit the merge, we can take a look at the state of the repo:

```
     B --- C
   /         \
  A - D - E - M  main_to_merge
```

Our branch now contains a new commit - where the merge occurred. In the repo
history, we can see _exactly_ what has happened. We can see the old branch,
and the commit that occurred at the same time as the merge.

In this case, the history of our branch is **not** linear.

### Rebasing

The other option we have to resolve this situation is to _rebase_ our feature
branch - but _what is rebasing?_

>[!IMPORTANT]
>As the name suggests, rebasing is the proccess of chaging the commit that a
>branch points to - _changing the base of the branch_.

Lets give rebase a go, recall we have the following situation:

```
     B --- C   step2
   /
  A - D - E    main
```

Once more, lets create a backup for the `main` branch:
```sh
git checkout main
git checkout -b main_to_use_in_rebase
```

Rebase works slightly differently to merge - we need to rebase our
_feature branch_ on _main_. This means we need to checkout the feature branch:

```sh
git checkout step2
git checkout -b step2-to-rebase
git rebase main_to_use_in_rebase
```

Notice the state of the repo:
```
            B --- C   *step2-to-rebase
           /
  A - D - E           main_to_use_in_rebase
```
By rebasing, we have not changed the main branch, we have only changed the
base of our feature branch. This was done by adding the commits on the main
branch onto `step2` until we reached the end of the main branch.

Notice that `step2` no longer diverges from `main_to_use_in_rebase` - i.e we
can _fast forward_ merge it:
```sh
git checkout main_to_use_in_rebase
git merge step2-to-rebase
```
and now:
```
  A - D - E - B - C     *main_to_use_in_rebase
```
We have a linear history - the branches are combined without a merge commit.


#### Pros

As we have seen, rebasing can give us a linaer history. This can make it really
clear exactly which commit introduced which change - and if we want to undo
a commit in the future, this will be _much_ easier with a linear history.

It isn't just undoing commits which is made easier with a linear history - It
makes it easier to selectively cherry-pick commits, as well as well as work out
the commit that introduced certain features or bugs.

#### Cons

When we rebased `step2`, what we effectively did was add the commits from `main`
at the start of `step2` - this _changes the history_ of the `step2` branch.

If this branch is just local, then this is not a problem. If this branch has
been pushed to GitHub, then this will cause a conflict between our branch and
the remote branch.

Equally, if someone else is working on the same branch, then this will cause a
conflict with their branch.

>[!IMPORTANT]

### Dealing with conflicts

Both rebasing and merging have the potential to generate conflicts. If the
commits on either of the branches modify the same piece of code, then a conflict
will occur.

When we merge the branches, we deal with the conflicts in the merge commit.

When we rebase, we will deal with the conflicts as the branch is rebased.
When we resolve the issues, there will be no record on the conflict occuring,
since the history will be updated in the rebase.

Lets create a conflict and deal with it. This is our current state:

```
     B --- C   step2
   /
  A - D - E    main
```
Lets add a line to our file on main:

```sh
git checkout main
echo "Added a line from main branch" > A
git commit A -m "A1"
```
We have now added a line to the top of our `A` file. Lets do something similar
from `step2`:

```sh
git checkout step2
echo "Added a line from step2 branch" > A
git commit A -m "A2"
```

Now we have this:

```
     B -- C - A2    step2
   /
  A - D - E - A1    main
```

The commits A1 & A2 will conflict with eachother. Lets see how we would resolve
this in a merge. We wil once again create a new branch, and merge step2 into
main.

```sh
git checkout main
git checkout -b main_to_merge_with_conflict
git checkout merge step2
```
You will notice a conflict:
```
Auto-merging A
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in A
Recorded preimage for 'A'
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```
If we take a look at A:
```
cat A

<<<<<<< HEAD
Added from main
=======
Added from step2
>>>>>>> step2

```
This is the representation of the conflict. `HEAD` refers to changes from the
current branch (main_to_merge_with_conflict), and `step2` shows our changes
from the branch we are merging in.

What this is telling us, is that we need to decide which change we want to keep
in our merged branch. To do this, we can go into the file, and delete the
changes from the branch we don't want.

Open the `A` file and select the changes from step2, the file should look like
this:
```
Added from step2
```
we now need to commit our changes:
```
git add .
git commit
```
Once more, you will see that we have a merge commit generated. This merge
commit will contain the resolution of the conflict.

Take a look at the git graph - Once more, we have a non-linear history, showing
us that a merge took place.


Now lets try the same, but using rebase:

```sh
git checkout main
git checkout -b main-to-resolve-conflict-rebase
git checkout step2
git checkout -b step2-to-use-in-rebase

git rebase main-to-resolve-conflict-rebase
```

Once more, we have a merge conflict, lets take a look at `A` once again:

```
cat A

<<<<<<< HEAD
Added from main
=======
Added from step2
>>>>>>> d17e956 (A2)
```

This looks similar to before - however something is different.

The `HEAD` here seems to be referenceing the main branch - that is strange,
since when we ran the `git rebase` command, we were on our `step2` branch.

This tells us how rebase works - when we run rebase from `step2`, git checks out
the other branch, and plays the commits from `step2` onto it. This is why it
looks like the 'current change' is from `main`, and the `incomming change` is
from `step2`.

We can resolve this conflict again - lets select the changes from the main
branch again.

Once this is done, we can continue the rebase:
```sh
git add A
git rebase --continue
```

We have succesfully rebased, lets take a look at the git log:

```
                 B - C   *step2-to-rebase
                /
  A - D - E - A1          main_to_use_in_rebase
```

Once again, we have a linear history - but look carefully, we no longer have
and `A2` commit. This is because in the rebase, we selected changes from the
`A1` commit, therefore there is no need to keep the A2 commit.

This is an example of rebase rewritting history on our feature branch. We have
resolved the conflict, and our branch is now up-to-date, but we have _lost_ some
history from our feature branch.

You could argue that this doesn't matter, since the A2 commit was useless
anyway, since we selected A1. Equally you could argue that this is dangerous,
because there is now no record of A2 in git at all - We cannot revert to it.

## Cherry Picking

Cherry picking allows us to select specfic commits to pull into our branch.

This can be incredibly useful if we want to select a specific feature, or
if we want to exclude specific commits that we know caused a bug.

Cherry picking can be made easier by the following considerations:
  - Linear History: Whist not strictly neccessary, it can be a lot easier to work
  out what commits you need when you have a linear history.
  - Good commit practices: If a single commit contains 3 different features and
  bug fixes, we won't be able to differentiate between them. We can either take
  all of the changes in that commit, or none of them. If we keep our commits small,
  and try to use one commit per feature, bugfix etc as a MAXIMUM, then cherry
  picking will be much easier

Lets have a go at cherry picking, we can reuse the state from the above step,
after the rebase:
```
                 B - C   *step2-to-rebase
                /
  A - D - E - A1          main_to_use_in_rebase
```

In this situation, lets say that I really need file `C` on the
`main_to_use_in_rebase` branch. I have a couple of options:

  1. I could manually create the file, or manually copy and paste the file
  2. I could cherry pick the commit that creates the file.

Option 1 is simple, but will cause us problems. By manually adding the file and
commiting it, we are creating a _new commit_. This commit is different to the
commit on `step2-to-rebase`, and therefore has the potential to create a
conflict.

Option 2 will copy the _exact same commit_ to the branch - meaning we won't have
any conflict - a commit cannot conflict with itself.

Lets do it, first, we will need to get the commit hash for `C`
```sh
git checkout step2-to-rebase
git log --oneline
```
We can now see the commit hash for `C` - we need to remember that.

Now we can checkout our other branch, and cherry pick that commit

```sh
git checkout main_to_use_in_rebase
git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
```

we can see that `C` has been created on our main branch, but not B - Success!

Currently we have this setup:

```
                 B - C       step2-to-rebase
                /
  A - D - E - A1 - C         *main_to_use_in_rebase
```

Because we have the same commit on both of our branches, we can actually rebase
`step2-to-rebase` on `main_to_use_in_rebase`, and it should simplify the
history:

```sh
git checkout step2-to-rebase
git rebase main_to_use_in_rebase
```
Now we have this:
```
                     B       step2-to-rebase
                    /
  A - D - E - A1 - C         *main_to_use_in_rebase
```

Note that we have no conflict, and we have effectively just taken the specific
feature we want from our branch. In this case we still have a linear history.

I think this give us an idea of how powerful cherry-picking and rebasing can be
when used properly.
